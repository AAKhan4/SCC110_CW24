# SCC110_CW24
Summer Term Java coursework - Air Hockey

This project runs a two player game of air hockey.
Each mallet can be moved in a user friendly manner (using WASD or arrow keys).
The game keeps count of each player's code and a game ends when a player gets 7 points.
The puck also moves in physics accurate manner in terms of collisions as well as friction.
The game also includes sound effects as well as start/end menus and the ability to pause mid game.
The sound effects featured can be muted and unmuted using paused screen menu.

The game can be run through the Main.java file.
